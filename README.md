## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installing

Install all above mentioned programs.

### Configure

The configuration is done via config.toml for Hugo & docker-compose.yml for Docker.

## Workflow

Adapt your CV via config.toml. The result will be automatically rendered to localhost:1313. As soon as you are finished you can create the PDF file via `docker-compose up -d wkhtmltopdf`. The result will be saved in the dist folder. The HTML files can be rendered by `docker-compose run hugo hugo`. The result can be found in public.
